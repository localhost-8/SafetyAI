This project is not real code and is presented as a more complicated system for collecting and transporting data to a text document. <br>
This model should show how you can collect data and collect them in groups. <br>
well, yes, there is no real code for checking accounts, etc. <br>
But, if you want to build your own model, then this resource will help you! <br>
